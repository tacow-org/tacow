# tacow Timeline

## 2006

* Apple sold only Macs—including PowerMacs—and iPods with buttons. There was no iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, or Apple Watch.
* iCloud was called .Mac (that was before MobileMe, but after iTools).
* You had to `-retain` and `-release`, and use square brackets.
* WWDC had early bird pricing, and ADC called to beg you to come. It also had feedback and WebObjects sessions.

### February

* Karl Moskowski and David LeBer get the idea to start a [CAWUG](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cawug)-like group.
* We take a road trip to Chicago for their [next meeting](http://lists.apple.com/archives/cocoa-dev/2006/Feb/msg00828.html), to see how they do things.
* We decide to call ourselves the "Toronto Area Cocoa and WebObjects Developers Group", with the quasi-acronym "tacow".
* We meet with Apple Canada's Willi Powell about starting the group.

### March

* We [announce](http://lists.apple.com/archives/cocoa-dev/2006/Mar/msg00483.html) the group.
*  [CocoaHeads](http://cocoaheads.org/) [lists us](http://cocoaheads.org/ca/TorontoOntario/index.html) as the first international chapter. They also send prizes for our first meeting.

### April

* About 50 people show up at our first meeting on April 11, at the Market Centre at Apple Canada's old Markham HQ. Karl does a presentation on setting up and using Subversion, and David speaks about using WebObjects with AJAX.

### July

* Our second meeting is our first at Ryerson University, thanks to a Willi Powell introduction. Mark Ritchie is the presenter, discussing the use of Shark to tune Cocoa & WebObjects apps.

### October

* Our biggest meeting ever—we had about 90 people to see pre-release demo of Leopard by Ken Bereskin, then a marketing VP at Apple. 

## 2006-2009

* Ryerson is our home. All of our meetings are there during this period.
* Presenters are hard to find, so it's often the Karl & Dave show.
* Our usual attendance is 15-20 people.

## 2010

* The rise of the iOS SDK makes presenters easier to find, so we switch to an every-other-month schedule.

### April

* Our first meeting at Metro Hall. It becomes our home for the next few years.

## 2013

### May

* Our first Meetup-powered meeting. [AgileBits](https://1password.com) covers our organizer fees.

## 2015

* We begin holding meetings at locations other than Metro Hall more frequently.

### January

* Our first "nomadic" meeting, at [The Score](http://thescore.com/).

## 2016

### May

* Our 51st meeting and our nominal 10th anniversary. During this time, we've had 28 different [speakers](Meetings.md).

### September

* After more than 10 years running tacow, Karl Moskowski and David LeBer step down as organizers, [handing over the reins to Robin Senior and Paddy O'Brien](https://www.meetup.com/tacow-org/messages/79085424/).
